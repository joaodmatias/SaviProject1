This program makes it possible to detect faces that appear on camera in real time.<br /> These faces will be recognized and associated with a premade database of the members of the group. If the face on camera is not in the database, the user will be asked for the name of the new person.<br /> After the user inputs the name, the image of the person and the new name will be added to the database.

After the recognition of the person, the detection will be associated with a tracker that will be disabled if it goes 2 seconds without a new associated detection. <br />

Everytime a new person joins the group, the system will say "Hello" to that person.
