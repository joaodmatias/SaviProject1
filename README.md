It is possible to Detect the faces that appears on the camera in real time, that faces may be recognized and be associated with a premade database that only have the members of the group. If the face on the camera is not at the database the user will be asked for the name of the new person, after the user input the name an image of the person and the new name will be added to the database.

After the recognition of the person the detection will be associaated with a tracker that will be disabled if it goes 2 secounds without a new detection associated to it.

Everytime a person join the capture the system will say "Hello" to that person.
